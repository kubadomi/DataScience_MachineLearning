## DataScience & MachineLearning


This is the place where I try to bite data sciene and machine learning from different angles.

#### 1) Echocardiogram:

Dataset: echocardiogram
 
 Algorithm: SVM classifier
 
 Problem: *optimization of sensitivity hyperparameter *missing data
 
#### 2) Probabilistic programming:

Dataset: films

Algorithm: pymc3 Gamma and Normal

Problem: Film rating as a random value described by normal distribution


#### 3) neuron_web:

Dataset: photos

Algorithm: SVM classifier (with face_recognition)

Problem: How much do faces differ from somebodys (each model is a set of preferenced beauty) liking
